## Introduction to LiDAR

LiDAR is a distance measurement technology that works by emitting laser pulses and measuring the time it takes for the light to return. The system is capable of sending over 160,000 pulses per second, creating a high-resolution point cloud of millions of points.

## How LiDAR Works

LiDAR systems, typically mounted on planes or helicopters, scan the ground from side to side. The vertical accuracy of LiDAR is about 15 cm, while the horizontal accuracy is 40 cm. By calculating the return time of each laser pulse, LiDAR can determine the elevation of the ground and objects such as trees or buildings.

## LiDAR Applications

1. **Forestry:** Understanding tree structure and canopy height.
2. **Self-driving cars:** Detecting pedestrians, cyclists, and obstacles.
3. **Archaeology:** Discovering ancient structures hidden in forests.
4. **Hydrology:** Mapping riverbeds and watercourses.

## LiDAR Outputs


1. **Digital Elevation Models (DEM):** Representations of the Earth's bare surface.

## Types of LiDAR

- **Topographic LiDAR:** Measures land using near-infrared light.
- **Bathymetric LiDAR:** Measures water depth using green light.
- **Ground-based LiDAR:** Scans buildings and terrain from the ground.
  
## LiDAR System Components

1. **LiDAR Sensors:** Emit and receive laser pulses.
2. **GPS Receivers:** Track the aircraft's location and altitude.
3. **Inertial Measurement Units (IMU):** Measure the aircraft's tilt and motion.
4. **Data Recorders:** Store the pulse return information for processing.

## Full Waveform vs Discrete LiDAR

- **Discrete LiDAR:** Records separate returns for each laser pulse.
- **Full Waveform LiDAR:** Records the entire return as one continuous wave.

## LiDAR Projects

- **Forestry:** Assessing canopy structures and forest health.
- **Self-Driving Cars:** Real-time obstacle detection.
- **Archaeology:** Discovering hidden ruins in dense forests.

## Summary

LiDAR is an advanced technology that uses laser pulses to measure distances and map environments with high precision. Its applications span multiple industries, from forestry to autonomous vehicles. By offering detailed terrain and object models, LiDAR continues to play a key role in scientific and industrial advancements.
